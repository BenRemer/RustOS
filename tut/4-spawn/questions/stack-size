We can implement a new kernel call grow_stack. This would allocate a new and bigger block of memory and copy the old stack into it. It would
then change the stack pointer to the new location.
grow_stack would look like:
mov x0, #(2 << 20)
sys 1 

Then:
let offset = stack.top() - context.sp;
context.sp = new_stack.top() - offset;
