I will go to the EBPB and find the cluster number from the root directory in the FAT32 table of that number index.
We then calculate the starting point of the FAT32 (# reserved sectors * # bytes per sector). We then find the 
starting point of the data section(# FAT32 sections * # sectors per FAT32 * bytes per sector + FAT32 starting point).
We read FAT32 ID, end-of-cluster-chain marker, and ID of the first data cluster. 
We use the ID to find the entry. If it is a LFN we can over entries to get the filename. 
If it is a directory we see if it is 'a'. If it is user the cluster id to find the subdirectory and look for 'b'.
Then we look for a file with name c.txt and find the cluster ID. We then have the starting cluster.
