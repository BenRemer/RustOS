One way would be to change how alignments are made. As it is now if a block gets allocated with an uncommon layout
it could take a long time for that block to get reused. If we can change this to be able to change the allocations
we can reuse this. 
Another way would be to sub-divide the allocations. When we allocate we use more space than needed.
If we sub-divide we can reuse this space.
